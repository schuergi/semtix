Starting from 2014, Michael Mertins finished up missing functionalities and is working on this software\r\nuntil today.\r\n\r\nIf you are related to a University AStA and/or Semesterticketb端ro and want to use this software, please contact the\r\nauthor who is reachable at MichaelMertins@gmail.com for consulting, initial help and support or just as a courtesy.\r\n\r\nWe are very interested in spreading and supporting this software and hope, many other offices will now be able to develop their\r\nown application software based on this as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING SEMTIX CLIENT\r\n======================\r\nOn each client:\r\n- Install _openjdk-7-(jre|jdk)_ and _libreoffice_ \r\n- Setup and configure printer, so `/usr/bin/soffice -p` works\r\n- Set `logo=0` in _sofficerc_, e.g. /etc/libreoffice/sofficerc, /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/sofficerc\r\n- Copy **semtixconf.properties, log4j.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml to /etc/semtixdb/** and adjust them to your environment\r\n- Create `/var/log/semtixdb/` and make accessible for users that run semtix\r\n- Copy templates folder to the place specified in semtixconf.properties\r\n- If you want to build the program you may also need to install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)\r\n- Execute `mvn clean install` where the _pom.xml_ file is located whenever you want to build from source with JDK7\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### FIRST STEPS ON CLIENT\r\n- Datenbank `->` Neues Semester Anlegen and create a new Semester\r\n- Datenbank `->` Aktuelles Semester and select the Semester as Global Semester\r\n- AdminTools and initialize all relevant settings. That also entails clicking on \"Speichern\" at the path settings in case a field is missing from your `semtixconf.properties`\r\n- Fill other data that is frequently used (e.g. Textbausteine)\r\n- In `DBHandlerTextbausteine.java` you may add default text blocks for daily usage and/or development/testing\r\n- Put your letter templates in the templates folder\r\n- In ExternalSettings.java you can specifiy the String values for these templates\r\n- May also need to set the templates in the `semtixconf.properties` \r\n- While printing letters or other documents you may run into problems as the engine expects several freemarker placeholders to be present. A complete list of placeholders is, at the moment, only available by looking at the java-code. We use code like this in our odt-templates:     \r\n      ``\r\n      ${vorname} ${nachname}[#if co??]${\"\\n\"}c/o ${co}[/#if]\r\n      [#if zusatz??]${\"\\n\"}${zusatz}[/#if] \r\n      ``  \r\n\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n### ON SERVER:\r\nThe server is only required to run the actual SQL database:\r\n- create postgresql db (we use driver 9.1-901-1.jdbc4 from within hibernate 4.3.8)\r\n  and make sure the db is accessible by clients (usually port 5432)\r\n- install `postgresql-contrib` and execute `CREATE EXTENSION unaccent;` on semtix db\r\n- Don't forget to configure `/etc/semtixdb/hibernate.cfg.xml` accordingly\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### HINTS/FAQ:\r\n- check the tests in order to understand the determination process of how much each student will get paid\r\n- other jdbc databases but PostgreSQL should also work but have not been tested\r\n- configure git to use odt2txt when pushing new Odt-Templates in order to avoid binary blobs  \r\n\r\nIn your .git/config :    \r\n``\r\n[diff \"odt\"]\r\n        binary = true\r\n        textconv = odt2txt\r\n``\r\n\r\nIn your .gitattributes :   \r\n`*.odt diff=odt`\r\n",
